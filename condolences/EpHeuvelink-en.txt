Dear all,


Also I am extremely saddened by the terrible news of the death of Prof. Hu Baogang. 

It is less than one month ago that he did send us a short email during his holidays in Wuyi San. We were looking forward to cooperate with Mengzhen and Prof. Hu in a new project on vertical farming, and we were working on a short review paper.  
I will remember Prof. Hu as a good scientist, but even more as a very friendly person, with a great interest in others.
