Dear Mengzhen,

It is indeed a really sad news.
I last saw him in 2018 when he came to stay in Centrale for a little while.
He seemed really happy and peaceful at this time.
He has had a very full and fruitful life, and I think that he was very 
happy to find someone like you, as his perfect student, then his very 
close collaborator, and trustworthy friend.
I also remember his very deep Chinese culture, and how he was eager to 
make me discover some beautiful and subtle things from your culture. He 
is also the one who taught me a little bit about drinking tea. And 
finally he also reminds me of a very happy period in which I was fully 
involved in the GreenLab project, with my frequent stays in Beijing, and 
our firendship.

I hope that you manage to keep your spirits high. There are many great 
memories to remember of him, and that's already a great achievement for 
his life.

Warm regards,

Paul-Henry.
