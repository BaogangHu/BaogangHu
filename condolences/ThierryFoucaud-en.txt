Dear all,

I am extremely saddened by the terrible news of the death of a colleague 
and friend.
I met Bao Gang, co-director of LIAMA with Philippe, during a first visit 
to China.Â  From the very first minutes, I could see, beyond his 
scientific skills, the great humanity and immense culture of this great 
man.
I will keep extraordinary moments of exchange and conviviality from him, 
at work but also at his home or in nice restaurants in Beijing, or at 
home where we welcomed him during his short stays in the Bordeaux region.
My thoughts go to his family, in particular to his wife and son with 
whom Alexia and I shared some good moments, but also to his colleagues 
and friends.
He will remain forever in our thoughts.
With my best regards
Thierry
