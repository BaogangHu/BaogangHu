Dear Mengzhen,
I am really sad and sorry to learn that Baogang has passed away.
I remember fondly the last time I met you both in Beijing, some time in 2015, if I am correct. I had notified Baogang at the last moment of my visit. You very kindly picked me up at my hotel to visit a temple, and then we had lunch nearby.

I also know that he has been a key actor in the development of plant models at LIAMA and more broadly in China and that Philippe de Reffye always praised Prof. Baogang Hu for this role. I do understand and share your sorrow.

Please accept my condolences and convey my warmest thoughts to his family and colleagues.
